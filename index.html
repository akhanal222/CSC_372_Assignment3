      <p> Welcome to the guide to find the best food spot within walking distance from the petty building. In this blog,
        I will give guidance to three different restaurants near the Petty Building that are affordable and delicious.
        The three restaurants I provide are among my favorite restaurants, and I will also provide must-try dishes from
        each restaurant. I've tried these spots myself and can say they never disappoint when it comes to great food
        close to campus. </p>
